Q1

Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?

Q2

 Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Java always passes parameter variables by value. Object variables in Java always point to the real object in the memory heap. A mutable object's value can be changed when it is passed to a method. An immutable object's value cannot be changed, even if it is passed a new value

● After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?

Because as we mentioned above java is pass by value. So that the function swap just swap o1 and o2 but not jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD. "I have a picture that describe more about this in this file"

● After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

The title of the JungleDVD changed because the function interact directly with the data in the located memory of JungleDVD through the setter
"I have a picture that describe more about this in this file"
